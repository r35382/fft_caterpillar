## About fft_caterpillar

This project is devoted for developing fastest FFT implementation based on
precompile tool-set using data driven approach

The original paper has been published in:
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1177589/Fast-Fourier-Transform-Caterpillar-Method

(you can find its pdf draft here: fft_caterpillar.pdf)

# Intention

The general intention is to find customers for further developing 
(porting or/and implementation of proposed optimisation)

Extra examples or ever minor modifications will be done for free and put here. 


## Contributing

If you have any idea, feel free to email or to fork it and submit your changes back to me.

## Roadmap

- Productize generating tool on the input language base (currently is semi-automated set of several programs)
- prototype of discrete cosine transform ...
